# Data structures

Computer science is an easy topic if you simplify all in only two components.
**Algorithms** and **Data structures**.

All things in software have this both areas Science, Data sciences, ML, Web,
IOT, Blockchain, Compilers, Databases etc.

This repository has only focused on Data structures.

But this repository tries to solve the question, Are Data structure important
topic for university or interviews context but not in real projects?

A common error in traditional learning, how to implement all data structures and
leetcode challenge but not how to use that in your real job challenge, for this
I built this repo with the next structure.

## Learning Path

### Modules

- Conceptual.
- Examples of real huge problems solved Netflix, Google, Uber etc.
- Implementations (C/C++, Rust)
- Leetcode challenges solution.
- Real examples solution implementations.
